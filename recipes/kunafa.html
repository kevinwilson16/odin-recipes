    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Knafeh is a traditional Arabic dessert, made with spun pastry called kataifi, soaked in a sweet, sugar-based syrup called attar, and typically layered with cheese, or with other ingredients such as clotted cream, pistachio or nuts, depending on the region. It is popular in the Middle East.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Kunafa</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>
        <li>Sugar syrup</li>
        <li>Corn starch</li>
        <li>Sweet cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the kunafa in halves and place the first half in your food processor while wrapping the other in the plastic bag of the package.</li>
        <li>Give it from 6-10 pulses stopping in between to release the kunafa threads from around the blade.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Melt ghee on stove top or microwave, then add Â¾ of the ghee to the knafeh.</li>
        <li>With your hands rub the ghee into knafeh until you are sure almost every thread is covered with ghee.</li>
        <li>Brush the bottom of your baking pan with some of the remaining melted ghee. Take half of the knafeh and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Press the knafeh using the bottom of another pan or a cup or a smaller plate. Press down and along the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the Ashta (milk pudding) mixture. Spread evenly leaving about half inch all around. Recipe for the Ashta is in the recipe card at the end of the post.</li>
        <li>If you are using the sweet cheese, then grate it and spread it evenly on top of the pudding.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining shredded knafeh , spread it evenly and press lightly with your finger tips.</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining melted ghee on top and bake until nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Pour cooled syrup over, let it soak and rest for 10-15 minutes. Invert on to a serving platter.</li>
    </ol>
